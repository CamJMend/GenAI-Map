      "description": "Perplexity AI: world’s most trusted AI search engine\nIntroduction\n\nDo you want to know how to use the Perplexity AI search engine? In this presentation, we’ll go through all the important features and even include the new ‘AI Profile’ option.\n\nWhat is Perplexity AI?\n\nPut simply, Perplexity is a powerful and intelligent search tool that lets you control where information comes from. You can ask questions and choose specific sources such as YouTube, Reddit, Wikipedia and many others.\n\nHow does Perplexity AI work?\n\nPerplexity AI works in a slightly different way to more familiar AI tools such as ChatGPT. With this search engine, you can ask questions, but you can also choose the source of information from which you want to obtain answers. As we explained, its strength lies in its ability to search across multiple platforms at once.\n\nA trusted search service\n\nWhat makes Perplexity AI particularly interesting for research is that it provides references for each piece of information provided. Unlike other similar tools, you don’t have to search for the sources yourself. The references are included directly in the text and you can click on them to access the sources immediately.\n\nTip: When you open Perplexity AI for the first time, be sure to set your search option to “all”.\n\nPerplexity AI’s search options\n\nPerplexity AI provides a number of search options to simplify your investigations and information control.\n\nCross-platform search: You can search for information on the Internet, YouTube, Wikipedia, Reddit and much more. This allows you to obtain results from different platforms, according to your requirements.\nUnderstanding content and reference links: When Perplexity.ai provides you with information, it also includes the corresponding references. You can click on these references to go directly to the sources used. This makes it easier to verify the information and access the original sources.\nChecking information : Perplexity AI lets you verify and fact-check the information it provides. You can also give your opinion on the accuracy of the information, which is useful for ensuring the reliability of the results. This is a very valuable option for researchers, journalists, scientists and the world of education (students, teachers, academics, etc.).\nSwitching between views: the site allows you to switch between different views of information presentation. You can choose to display a concise version of the text or return to the detailed version with integrated references.\nSource access in a pop-up window: When you consult the references of a piece of information, Perplexity AI opens a pop-up window containing the original source. This allows you to quickly consult sources without having to leave the search page.\nRemoving unwanted sources: If you wish to remove certain sources from your search results, you can do so with a single click. So you can easily exclude sources that are not relevant or reliable. You’ll get more accurate results.\nTranscriptions of video sources: Perplexity AI includes transcripts and video sources in search results. This allows you to view video transcripts and check the sources used to obtain the information.\nPerplexity’s Chrome extension\n\nLet’s move on to our most popular feature: Perplexity’s Chrome extension. With it, you can ask questions, summarize a web page and customize your search box. This intelligent search engine can, for example, summarize any article for you in no time at all. So you don’t have to read the whole article.\n\nWhat’s more, you can ask questions about a specific web page or an entire domain. Finally, if you click on the “internet” button, you’ll get the same enriched search system as on the web version of Perplexity.ai.\n\nThe extension for the Google Chrome browser can be downloaded free of charge from ce lien\n\nThe new “AI Profile” feature\n\nLet’s take a look at Perplexity’s new “AI profile” feature. How it works is simple: tell the AI about yourself to get more personalized results. In fact, the more information you share about how you work, the more relevant your search results will be.\n\nExample: If you need a cover letter, the search engine takes your work experience into account and helps you to design it. You can, of course, extend this to other fields and be very creative.\n\nPrice of Perplexity AI\n\nThe best news is that all the possibilities you’ve just read about can be realized with a free account – no subscription is necessary. However, if you want even better results, you can subscribe to a “Pro GPT4” account.\n\nNote that the current price of the pro version is $20 per month or $200 per year.\n\nReview and conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Perplexity AI revolutionizes online information retrieval. It far surpasses traditional search engines like Google, and we highly recommend it.\n\nFAQ\nHow does the Perplexity Chrome extension work?\n\nPerplexity’s Chrome extension lets you ask questions, summarize a web page and customize your search box. You can also query a single web page or an entire industry sector.\n\nDoes Perplexity AI work for academic research?\n\nYes, the site has a search tool dedicated to academic publications. You can enter a subject or a question and obtain answers based on scientific publications only.\n\nCan I customize my results with Perplexity’s AI profile?\n\nIt’s perfectly possible! With the new service called “AI profile”, you can share details about yourself to get more personalized results.\n\nIs Perplexity AI free?\n\nYes, Perplexity.ai offers a free account.

      "description": "ChatGPT: Optimize your work with AI\n\nSummary :\n\nWhat is ChatGPT?\nHow does ChatGPT generate text?\nHow to use this AI to generate SEO content?\nAutomatic responses with ChatGPT?\nThe unknown secrets of ChatGPT\nEmail writing\nWriting of articles\nWriting poems\nSome ideas for using ChatGPT:\nChatGPT and video platforms\nFree alternatives to ChatGPT\nGet ready for the future with GPT-4\nBenefits and precautions to take when using ChatGPT\nChatGPT, what is it?\n\nChat GPT is a language processing model developed by OpenAI that uses a neural network to generate text. This is based on a previously developed model called GPT-2 (less powerful). From now on, we are on GPT-4 and GPT-5 is coming! To put it more simply: this intensive training allows this AI to understand the relationships between words and sentences.\n\nHow does ChatGPT generate text?\n\nChatGPT uses a technique called “generation by transfer” to get more natural text. Basically, it takes a “prompt” (a sentence or question) as input and generates a response. It uses the information learned during its training. What’s more, it is quite capable of continuing a sentence or conversation in a fluent manner, so it has memory!\n\nHow to use this AI to generate SEO content\n\nEssentially by giving it a prompt on the topic you want to cover. After that, it will automatically generate SEO content. It is also possible to use it to write articles, blog posts, movie scripts, etc.\n\nAutomatic responses with ChatGPT?\n\nFrom its conception, ChatGPT was imagined with the goal of generating automatic responses. Feeding your chatbot will therefore be hassle-free. Nevertheless, direct it anyway with a prompt for each possible situation. This way, it will offer you adapted answers for each situation. With time, your chatbot will become smarter and more natural.\n\nChatGPT’s unknown secrets\n\nThere are several facets of the Chat GPT application that are less known to the general public. For example, training the AI with specific data (to improve results in specific areas). Admittedly, this is a bit more technical, but it increases its performance tenfold. There are also keyboard shortcuts or commands that allow for summaries or translations.\n\nOther than that, combining multiple ChatGPT-stamped templates together increases the application’s functionality. More concretely, for example, the use of this artificial intelligence in combination with a speech recognition model can allow the creation of a voice assistant. Webmasters and developers will also be able to code more simply in Python, HTML, JavaScript and more.\n\nEmail writing\n\nLike other AI, Chat GPT can be used to write professional emails quickly and efficiently. Simply mention the context and a specific question, and ChatGPT will generate the email content. Another fairly common use is to use it to review (beware of cheating) and correct existing emails.\n\nWriting articles\n\nArticle writing (SEO) is really quite impressive. In fact, this chatbot can generate article ideas, headlines, and even full paragraphs. The result is often of good quality. Useful or even indispensable for research, it generates summaries of documents (even very long ones) or relevant quotes.\n\nPoem writing\n\nFor the more poetic among us, ChatGPT will be able to design poems for you for free. In fact, just provide a theme or inspiration and Chat GPT will generate verses and stanzas to create a complete poem. The generation of rhymes and meters to write poems in turn works wonderfully.\n\nSome ideas for using ChatGPT:\nCreation of video game dialogue.\nWriting computer codes.\nCreation of speech synthesis for applications.\nGeneration of answers for chatbots.\nContent for social networks.\nWriting of scripts for films and TV series.\nAutomatic language translation.\nWriting of reports.\nMinutes of meetings.\nVerification of legal documents.\nSEO content for websites.\nSummary and question-answer generation (FAQ).\n\nAs you can see, to automate tedious and repetitive tasks, there is nothing better nowadays. Improving performance is now very accessible. In fact, the possibilities of using ChatGPT are almost infinite and depend mainly on one’s imagination.\n\nChatGPT and video platforms\n\nChatGPT can in this regard be used to create videos on sites like YouTube or TikTok. Since a few weeks, most of the “Tiktokers” are already using this AI to generate video scripts, catchy titles or “trend” descriptions. As for the youtubers, they use it to make automatic subtitles, using other AIs like voice readers (TexToSpeech). In short, with this fabulous artificial intelligence, you save a lot of time and effort when editing videos.\n\nFree alternatives to ChatGPT\n\nIf ChatGPT becomes a paid service, there are several reliable and secure alternatives to consider. For the moment, there are not many chatbots that can match the level of OpenAI’s AI. Nevertheless, some AIs are slowly starting to make a name for themselves. Moreover, they often offer an excellent free alternative to ChatGPT and its monopoly.\n\nThe top 10 list of alternatives:\n\nYou.com : A Chatbot version of an AI search engine.\nPerplexity AI : He answers all your questions.\nChatSonic : A true clone of ChatGPT.\nAndi : A very competent personal assistant.\nJasper : The multi-tasking chatbot, it can do everything.\nGet ready for the future with GPT-4\n\nThe future of ChatGPT is bright with the arrival of GPT-4 (successor to GPT-3). This more advanced version offers even more impressive capabilities in text understanding and generation. The possible applications for GPT-4 are almost limitless, ranging from creating premium content to solving very complex problems. Truth be told, we look forward to seeing how these developments will continue to improve AI and shape the future of our world.\n\nBenefits and precautions to take when using ChatGPT\n\nBy using ChatGPT, it is true that you generate SEO content for your website, blog or chatbot. However, it should be noted that Chat GPT is a perfectible template, so there may be errors or inconsistencies in the generated text. As a result, you should definitely proofread and correct your text before uploading it to your projects.\n\nIn summary, ChatGPT is a powerful tool for small or large projects. Despite the (justified) hype at the moment for this AI, it is important to remember that it should be used with caution. Always remember that you need to respect the ethical and legal rules regarding intellectual property when using ChatGPT. So make sure you don’t violate any copyrights if there are any.\n\nThe trick has been done regarding this rather famous assistant, now it’s time to leave to join your new virtual companion!\n\n VISIT CHATGPT WEBSITE\nMore sites like  \nChatGPT\n  in the category:  \n#AI CHAT & ASSISTANT\n\nTEXT WRITTEN BY A\nHUMAN",

      "description": "Midjourney: AI to generate images from text\n\nMidjourney is an artificial intelligence that uses natural language processing and image generation algorithms to create quality illustrations. So this new technology generates images from text descriptions (called a prompt). This makes it an ideal tool for artistic projects. Obviously, creators of marketing campaigns or image enthusiasts will be the first to be interested.\n\nDiscover what Midjourney is\n\nOne of the many advantages of Midjourney is that it allows you to create images in a fast, free and efficient way. Its use is done without needing any knowledge of design or complex software (Photoshop for example). You become a “real” artist! Indeed, you just have to provide a description of the desired image, and Midjourney takes care of the rest. No doubt that this AI will be particularly useful if you are out of inspiration.\n\nNote well that, as with any artificial intelligence, there are limits to what this AI can do. First, the quality of the images generated will depend on the accuracy and clarity of your textual description. However, Midjourney continues to improve through continuous learning.\n\nHow to use Midjourney on Discord?\n\nBefore you can play with this image generator, you must create an account and join the Discord server. If you can’t find the Discord server, it is on the Midjourney homepage, click on the button: “Join the Beta”. Once this task is done (not very practical I must admit), enter the command /imagine to generate images. For example, if you want a cosmonaut cat in a realistic style in 4K, you can type /imagine 4K realist cosmonaut cat. Like other competitors, English is required on this site.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to maximize your creations in Midjourney for sure. As a result, you will enjoy all the possibilities offered by this artificial intelligence. The results are usually quite incredible and should suit your future artistic or advertising projects.\n\nDo you want more detailed images? With a particular style? Then specify more relevant words for even more precise illustrations.\n\nSome tips for making a high-performance prompt:\nBe specific in your description: the more specific you are in your description, the closer the generated image will be to what you want. Also use precise words to describe the image you want, such as colors, shapes, textures, etc.\nRelevant search terms: build your prompt so that it looks like a Google search. This way you will get the best results.\nBe clear in your request: use simple and clear sentences to describe the image you want. Avoid choosing terms that are too technical or difficult to understand.\nThe style of the image: indicate the style of the image you want, for example realistic, cartoon, etc..\nSpecify the dimensions of the image: specify the desired dimensions for the image, this will allow Midjourney to generate an image directly at the right size.\nUse examples: There are sites like Lexica.art or PromptMania to give you some ideas. Feel free to include them in your prompt and see if the result suits you. Your imagination will do the rest!\nConclusion and review\n\nIn conclusion, Midjourney is certainly the most successful AI for creating images by text. The use of Midjourney is, to date, “free”. In fact, you receive 25 credits as a gift as soon as you register. Thereafter, you will have to use this credit system to continue generating additional images. Midjourney.com is becoming more and more popular at the moment and in our opinion its potential is huge for the future.\n\nThe complete list of all Midjourney commands:\nBasic Midjourney commands\nCommand\tDescription\n/imagine\tFor example, /imagine an apple pie\n/help\tTo get help\n/subscribe\tTo subscribe to the BOT\n/info\tGeneral information\n/fast\tAccelerate generation\n/relax\tYour images generate more slowly\n/public\tGenerate your images in public\n/show < jobid >\tTo review any image\n/private\tGenerate your images privately\nSettings “/imagine”\n\nYou can add parameters after “/imagine” to specify resolution, size, speed, prohibitions, etc..

        "description": "Runway ML: A revolution in video editing using AI\n\nRunway ML is a kind of online full-featured video editing software, using machine learning (AI). The site has many advanced features for video creators. Accessible via a browser, it offers tools for masking, color correction, compositing, generation and special effects.\n\nWith its rotoscoping capabilities, you can easily turn any movie into a green screen and edit it. Runway ML’s Inpainting tool automatically removes unnecessary elements and objects from a video, speeding up the editing process.\n\nWhy choose this video editing software\n\nTruth be told, Runway isn’t really a piece of software. Still, it offers a similar experience to high-end video editors such as After Effects and DaVinci Resolve. Thanks to the cloud, it supports 4K video editing and exporting as well as formats like PNG and ProRes. Being fully online, you don’t have to worry about downloads or storage.\n\nRunway’s magic tools\n\nRunwayML’s magical tools make it much easier to create professional videos at a lower cost. In fact, they leverage recent advances in computer graphics and deep learning to push the boundaries of content creation.\n\nWork as a team through the cloud\n\nWeb-based accessibility allows teams to work together in real time, from any location. Runway ML’s AI-based tools make special effects and video editing accessible on any Internet-connected device. Plus, updates and cloud storage allow projects to be accessed from anywhere in the world.\n\nRotoscoping\n\nRotoscoping is Runway’s strong point, allowing intelligent identification of people and objects. It compares favorably to tools such as Adobe Rotobrush 2.0. Inpainting, on the other hand, is a contextual fill tool for removing unwanted objects from videos.\n\nRunway ML and Gen-1\n\nRunwayML’s recently launched Gen-1 is an impressive artificial intelligence. This software has the ability to modify pre-existing videos to generate new ones, using text or images as references.\n\nIn an online presentation on its platform, Runway revealed to users how Gen-1 works. The video demonstrates how the AI turns individuals walking down the street into animated figures. The startup has great confidence in this innovation, as Cristóbal Valenzuela, Runway’s co-founder, pointed out, “We have seen significant growth in generative image models.”\n\nPrices and available options\n\nWith these magical tools, you can create and edit things like green screens in just a few clicks. The free account offers standard features, 1GB of storage, export options up to 720p and unlimited projects. Paid editions offer more features and storage. Prices are quite reasonable ranging from $15 per month for the Starter version to $100 per month for the Pro version.\n\nFeatures and benefits of Runway Pro\n\nRunwayML is especially useful for those who work with green screens or want to optimize their movie in seconds. However, as we have seen, many features are only available to users of the Pro version.\n\nSome of the benefits of RunwayML Pro include simplified workflows for both experienced designers and beginners. You also have access to powerful tools for performing complex tasks such as rotoscoping, background removal and various AI-assisted video edits.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, RunwayML is an online video editing software with many features, ranging from basic editing to advanced post-production. It provides an experience comparable to a professional video production studio.\n\n VISIT RUNWAY ML WEBSITE\nMore sites like  \nRunway ML\n  in the category:  \n#VIDEO EDITION\n\nTEXT WRITTEN BY A\nHUMAN",

        "description": "Bard AI: The alternative to Google’s ChatGPT\n\nBard AI is the official text and content generator from Google. It is able to create original and creative text using its neural network. Like ChatGPT, it also has a memory and can therefore hold a conversation for a long time.\n\nWhat is Bard AI?\n\nThe artificial intelligence Bard AI is in fact, a language model developed by Google and similar to GPT-3 and GPT-4. It uses the LaMDA network to understand and produce human language in order to be able to talk properly. Bard AI can actually answer questions on a wide range of topics. In addition, it has been programmed to do all sorts of tasks in automatic mode. In short, it is an AI that will be very useful for companies, developers, but also for AI fans.\n\nAn alternative to ChatGPT\n\nThis time, we have a real competitor and therefore a real alternative to ChatGPT. OpenAI has a head start, of course, but it’s a safe bet that Google’s entry into the world of conversational AI, will remain an important moment for this industry. Clearly, the offering is growing for the consumer and thus the performance (and future prices as well). Who will win this competition in the AI race? Who can say, but Bard AI will have a say, that’s for sure. What about if Google decided to use its impressive data linked to its search engine…\n\nHow to test Bard AI ?\n\nFor now, Google’s AI is still in beta and available to testers (hand-picked). Therefore, you must request access before you can use it. Once this is done, you will receive a login link, and you will be able to see the full capabilities of the LaMDA algorithm. In theory, the speed and quality of the generated texts should be good (if we trust the words of Google CEO Sundar Picha).\n\nReviews of Bard.ai\n\nIt’s hard to make an opinion for now, because this intelligent chatbot is not really released yet. To date, only a few lucky people have the right to use it. We’ll update this article when we’ll have it in our hands.\n\nUpdate: if you want to test the beta version of Bard, go to the page Google Bard. Click the “Join Waitlist” button and sign in with your Google account.\n\nInfo: if you don’t see the blue invitation button, you are not in a country supported by Bard at the moment. A solution would be to try to connect with a VPN by setting your location to the USA.\n\n VISIT BARD AI (GEMINI) WEBSITE\nMore sites like  \nBard AI (Gemini)\n  in the category:  \n#AI CHAT & ASSISTANT\n\nTEXT WRITTEN BY A\nHUMAN",

        "description": "PimEyes: Protect your Online Identity with AI\n\nThe digital age has brought us PimEyes, a search engine that is revolutionising facial recognition. With an impressive database, this website promises to find your image online in the blink of an eye. But this technical feat raises important questions about privacy.\n\nHow does PimEyes work?\n\nImagine being able to find your photo on the web in just a few seconds. That’s what PimEyes is all about. You upload an image, accept the terms and voilà! Results appear with links to the sites where the image is published. Handy, but it does make us wonder about the impact of such technologies on our anonymity.\n\nThe strengths of this AI\n\nThe AI developed by PimEyes is designed to be the guardian of your digital image. It helps you combat identity theft and the illegal use of your photos. With a subscription, you can even receive alerts to monitor your online presence. Paid subscriptions offer additional features such as up to 25 searches per day and alerts when new photos appear online.\n\nLimitations\n\nHowever, the tool does have its shadows. Groups like Big Brother Watch are warning of the risks of harassment and surveillance. Isn’t being recognised everywhere, all the time a bit much?\n\nAlternatives to PimEyes?\n\nAlthough PimEyes.com is one of the tools most accessible to the general public, there are other facial recognition databases such as FaceCheck ID for example. These alternatives also raise ethical questions\n\nFrequently asked questions about PimEyes\nIs it possible to disappear from PimEyes?\n\nThe site offers an option to ‘hide’ images in search results, but this requires a paid subscription and is not always a guarantee of complete removal.\n\nCan PimEyes be used for illegal activities?\n\nAlthough the site rules stipulate that searches must be carried out on oneself or with the consent of the person concerned, there is nothing technically to prevent malicious use of the tool.\n\nWhat security measures has the website put in place?\n\nThe company claims to have detection tools to intercept abuse of its service, but the effectiveness of these measures remains a subject of debate among security and privacy experts.\n\nConclusion and opinion\n\nPimEyes confronts us with a modern dilemma. It’s a fascinating tool, but one that needs to be used with awareness. It reminds us of the importance of protecting our digital identity while respecting that of others. Regulation could be the key to balancing innovation and respect for privacy.\n\n VISIT PIMEYES WEBSITE\nMore sites like  \nPimEyes\n  in the category:  \n#AI DETECTION\n\nTEXT GENERATED BY\nAI",

        "description": "AutoGPT: The new autonomous and versatile AI\nWhat is AutoGPT?\n\nAutoGPT is an experimental, open-source application based on the OpenAI GPT-4 model. It operates autonomously, i.e., it can perform tasks with little human intervention and self-initiate instructions. Unlike ChatGPT, which requires human guidance to complete tasks, Auto-GPT is able to determine the steps needed to achieve a given goal. A real revolution seems to be taking place in the world of artificial intelligence.\n\nWho created Auto-GPT?\n\nIt was on March 30, 2023 that AutoGPT was published on GitHub by the developer Significant Gravitas. However, the application is powered by GPT-4, the latest and most advanced AI model from OpenAI.\n\nCapabilities of this AI\n\nThis AI has Internet access, short and long term memory management, and can store and summarize files using GPT-3.5. In addition to this, it is capable of performing more complex tasks than ChatGPT, including planning and executing multi-step projects.\n\nLimitations and access to AutoGPT\n\nDespite its impressive capabilities, it has some limitations, especially in complex real-world scenarios. In addition, unlike ChatGPT, which is accessible via a Web browser, Auto-GPT requires downloading a specific software. You will also need to master the basics of the Python language to use it. So it is not yet accessible to everyone.\n\nAutoGPT and the future of AI\n\nBecause of its autonomous capabilities, AutoGPT is considered by some to be a first glimpse of general artificial intelligence (GAI). This new form of AI could revolutionize the world of work and replace many human tasks.\n\nAutoGPT versus ChatGPT\n\nAlthough ChatGPT is a very capable chatbot, it is limited to the answers it can provide based on the directions it is given. AutoGPT, on the other hand, can perform tasks without requiring the user to know all the steps in between. However, as we have seen before, accessing it is more complex than accessing ChatGPT, which may make the latter more suitable for simpler needs.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIn closing: AutoGPT is a promising and powerful AI tool that offers new possibilities in terms of autonomy and versatility. In fact, the potential implications of this technology could transform various industries and professions.\n\nGoogle Colab for AutoGPT\n\n VISIT AUTOGPT WEBSITE\nMore sites like  \nAutoGPT\n  in the category:  \n#AUTONOMOUS AI",
